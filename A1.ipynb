    "## Inspiration\n",
    "As a foreign student that has never lived the American life, there has been a lot to take in ever since my arrival in late September. In particular, the ***imperial system of units*** has been more than difficult to cope with personally. I have decided to use this opportunity to familiarize myself with it. Hopefully, by walking through most that people use in their daily lives with functions, I will have less of a headache judging if it is a good deal next time I go for grocers."
